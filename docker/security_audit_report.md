# Security Audit Report
## SAR Meta World Infrastructure

**Date**: July 18, 2025  
**Auditor**: System Administrator  
**Scope**: Full infrastructure stack including databases, monitoring, and services

---

## Executive Summary

This security audit has been conducted on the SAR Meta World infrastructure to verify service health, access controls, and security configurations. The audit covers all deployed services including frontend, backend, databases, monitoring tools, and proxy services.

## Service Health Status

### ✅ **HEALTHY SERVICES**
- **Frontend (Vite)**: Port 5173 - Accessible and responding
- **Prometheus**: Port 9090 - Healthy with proper redirects
- **Node Exporter**: Port 9100 - Collecting system metrics
- **Redis Exporter**: Port 9121 - Monitoring Redis performance
- **Postgres Exporter**: Port 9187 - Database metrics collection
- **PostgreSQL**: Port 5432 - Database accessible and healthy
- **Redis**: Port 6379 - Cache service operational
- **Adminer**: Port 8080 - Database management interface
- **Redis Commander**: Port 8081 - Redis management interface
- **MQTT Broker**: Port 1883 - Message broker operational
- **MQTT WebSocket**: Port 9001 - WebSocket interface active
- **Nginx Proxy**: Port 8088 - Reverse proxy operational

### ⚠️ **SERVICES REQUIRING ATTENTION**
- **Backend API**: Port 3001 - Not responding (connection refused)
- **Grafana**: Port 3000 - Container restarting, not accessible
- **InfluxDB**: Port 8086 - Container restarting, not accessible

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **Password Strengthening**
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: Strong password configured (JMbVyXdJ2eN5nZcPcO8eNzfvO)
- ✅ **Redis**: Password authentication enabled (+fIQO/+ARzHgYBPgxk7Q+zgYPUi7biCuex/e3kNWMec=)
- ✅ **InfluxDB**: Secure admin token configured (0yH3JRDePlimwMXunzQlXQML9QfBLabojbrqE00ypvc=)
- ✅ **Grafana**: Strong admin password configured (YOSxJuQepot5RBhg3vWaLDY1w)
- ✅ **MQTT**: Authentication enabled with secure credentials
- ✅ **Redis Commander**: HTTP basic auth enabled

### 2. **Access Control**
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication enabled
- ✅ **Redis**: Password authentication required
- ✅ **MQTT**: Anonymous access disabled, password file configured
- ✅ **Grafana**: User registration disabled

### 3. **Network Security**
- ✅ **Docker Networks**: Isolated backend and frontend networks
- ✅ **Service Isolation**: Services properly containerized
- ✅ **Port Binding**: Services bound to specific interfaces

## Security Recommendations

### **HIGH PRIORITY**
1. **Fix Backend API Service**: Investigate and resolve connection issues
2. **Stabilize Grafana**: Resolve container restart issues (plugin installation problems)
3. **Fix InfluxDB**: Resolve container restart issues

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
1. **Enable TLS/SSL**: Configure HTTPS for all web interfaces
2. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **Regular Security Updates**: Establish update schedule for container images

### **LOW PRIORITY**
1. **Implement Log Rotation**: Configure log rotation for all services
2. **Add Monitoring Alerts**: Set up alerts for service failures
3. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated backup procedures

## Firewall Status

The system is running on macOS with application-level firewall. All services are accessible on localhost. For production deployment, additional firewall rules should be configured to:

- Restrict external access to management interfaces
- Allow only necessary ports through the firewall
- Implement IP whitelisting for administrative access

## Compliance Status

### **COMPLIANT**
- ✅ Strong passwords for all services
- ✅ Authentication enabled where required
- ✅ Service isolation through containerization
- ✅ Monitoring and logging in place

### **REQUIRES ATTENTION**
- ⚠️ TLS/SSL not configured (development environment)
- ⚠️ Some services experiencing stability issues
- ⚠️ No automated security scanning implemented

## Action Items

1. **Immediate (0-24 hours)**
   - Fix backend API connectivity
   - Resolve Grafana container issues
   - Stabilize InfluxDB service

2. **Short-term (1-7 days)**
   - Enable TLS/SSL for production
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Set up monitoring alerts

3. **Long-term (1-4 weeks)**
   - Establish backup procedures
   - Implement security scanning
   - Create disaster recovery plan

## Conclusion

The infrastructure security has been significantly improved with strong password policies and proper authentication mechanisms. While most services are healthy and secure, attention is needed for the backend API, Grafana, and InfluxDB services. The implemented security measures provide a solid foundation for a production-ready environment.

**Overall Security Rating**: 7.5/10 (Good - with room for improvement)
