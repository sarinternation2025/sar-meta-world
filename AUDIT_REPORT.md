## 3. Component Hierarchy and Data Flow Charts

### Frontend Component Hierarchy

The frontend application is built with React and follows a component-based architecture. The component hierarchy is organized as follows:

```
src/
├── app/           # Redux store and hooks
├── components/    # Reusable UI components
│   ├── Globe.jsx
│   ├── DataPanel.jsx
│   ├── Gauge.jsx
│   └── ...
├── features/      # Application features (e.g., chat)
│   └── ...
├── layouts/       # Layout components
│   └── DashboardLayout.jsx
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── ...
└── App.jsx        # Main application component
```

**Key Components:**

- **`App.jsx`**: The root component of the application.
- **`DashboardLayout.jsx`**: The main layout for the monitoring dashboard.
- **`DataPanel.jsx`**: A component for displaying data, likely used for metrics.
- **`Gauge.jsx`**: A gauge component for visualizing metrics like CPU and memory usage.
- **`Globe.jsx`**: A component that displays a globe, which might be used for visualizing network data.

### Frontend Data Flow

The frontend application uses a unidirectional data flow pattern, which is typical for React applications using Redux. The data flow can be summarized as follows:

1.  **API Interaction:** The application fetches data from the backend API using Redux async thunks or a similar mechanism.
2.  **Redux Store:** The fetched data is stored in the Redux store.
3.  **Component Rendering:** React components subscribe to the Redux store and re-render when the data changes.
4.  **User Interaction:** User interactions trigger actions that are dispatched to the Redux store, which may in turn trigger new API requests.

### Backend Data Flow

The backend is a Node.js application that serves as the API for the frontend. Based on the `MONITORING_SYSTEM.md` file, the backend's data flow is as follows:

1.  **API Endpoints:** The backend exposes a RESTful API with endpoints for retrieving system metrics, service status, logs, alerts, and configuration.
2.  **Data Sources:** The backend retrieves data from various sources:
    -   **System Metrics:** The backend likely uses a library like `systeminformation` to gather real-time data on CPU, memory, and disk usage.
    -   **Service Status:** The backend checks the health of the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
    -   **Logs:** The backend can retrieve logs, likely from the Docker containers or from log files.
    -   **Alerts:** The backend generates alerts based on predefined rules.
    -   **Configuration:** The backend manages the system's configuration.
3.  **Data Storage:** The backend stores data in the following databases:
    -   **PostgreSQL:** For structured data, such as configuration and possibly historical data.
    -   **InfluxDB:** For time-series data, such as system metrics.
4.  **Real-time Communication:** The backend uses WebSockets or MQTT for real-time communication with the frontend.
